Describe three collision resolution strategies not mentioned here.
1) Robin Hood Hashing:
    when you probe for a position to insert a new element, if the probe length 
    for the existing element is less than the current probe length for the element 
    being inserted, swap the two elements and keep going.
    
2) Hopscotch Hatching
    Variation of Open Addressing w/ buckets. You hash an element and look at the
    bucket it sends you to. If that bucket is full, you look at it's "neighborhood",
    or bucekts that are close by, for an opening. If nothing in the neighborhood is available,
    resize the array.
    
3) Coalesced Hashing
    Combination of open addressing and separate chaining. You use separate chaining
    as normal until your Load Factor is reached. But then instead of resizing, you
    use any open addressing method (linear, quadratic, hopscotch, etc) to move the hashed
    element to a new slot.



Create your own collision resolution strategy and describe how it works.

Separate chaining until you have X elements chained at the same index, whatever X
value you want as the maximum. Then the next element to get hashed to that index,
instead of chaining a 6th element, you would move the index up 1. It is like linear
open addressing combinged with separate chaining. So instead of resizing the array
at a certain load factor, you are just caping off the max chain size and moving the index
along.

When performing a lookup, you would check the index you are hashed too, checking for the key.
If the key is not found, you just need to move the index along 1 and check that next chain.

There can be a limit set to the number of index moves before resizing occurs. Basically if there
is not a spot available in the first 3 indexes, the array is resized.
