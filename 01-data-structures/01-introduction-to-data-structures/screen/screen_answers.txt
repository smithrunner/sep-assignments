How does your data structure allow developers to access and 
manipulate the data?

Developers can access pixel info as well as create/insert pixels into
the matrix.
---------------------------------------------------
If a developer wanted to find a specific element in your data structure,
how would you search for it?

They can use the #at method to find an element at a specific coordinate.
----------------------------------------------------
What other real-world data can each structure represent?

This type of 2D data set where each element contains data is used in a lot
of geophysical surveys. Think for example if you did a magnetics survey 
where over a 1km by 1km grid on a field, you measured the Earth's magnetic
field every 1 meter. You could represent that using a this data structure. Your
width/height would be the lengths of your survery area. And instead of pixel
info (r,g,b) at each element, you would have a magnetic field strength measurement,
so Tesla (or Nano-tesla).
