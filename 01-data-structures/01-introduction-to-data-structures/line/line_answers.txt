How does your data structure allow developers to access 
and manipulate the data?

My data structure allows you to add/remove strings from the array. (Members
from the line).
----------------------------------------------------------
If a developer wanted to find a specific element in your data structure,
how would you search for it?

Index through each element in the array and test to see if it matches
the specific element you are searching for.
------------------------------------------------------------

What other real-world data can each structure represent?

This structure could represent anything where you needed a list and the
order mattered. An example would be a sign-up sheet for an online class where
space is limited. Since it is first-come-first-serve, the order of the list
is important.
